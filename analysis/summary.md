# Refactoring Summary: Phase 1

## Completed Changes

1. **Configuration Management**

   - Implemented Pydantic-based settings in `core/settings.py`
   - Replaced manual environment variable handling with Pydantic's built-in support
   - Added validation and better typing for configuration values
   - Simplified JSON config loading with Pydantic models

2. **HTTP Client**

   - Created shared HTTP client module in `utils/http.py` using HTTPX
   - Implemented connection pooling and proper lifecycle management
   - Added error handling and logging
   - Refactored Ollama client to use the shared HTTP client

3. **Project Structure**
   - Updated dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
   - Updated `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Removed obsolete `config.py` (replaced by `settings.py`)

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: LangChain Integration

- Create LangChain conversation manager
- Implement memory persistence
- Integrate with MCP tools

### Priority 2: Process Management

- Integrate python-daemon for MCP server management
- Implement proper daemon lifecycle management
- Add structured logging for process status

### Priority 3: Structured Logging

- Integrate structlog
- Add context processors for request/response data
- Configure proper formatters for different environments

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Code Reduction**

   - Configuration: ~100 lines â†’ ~80 lines
   - HTTP Client: Removed duplicate session management
   - Common error handling

2. **Improved Reliability**

   - Automatic validation of configuration values
   - Proper connection pooling
   - Consistent error handling

3. **Better Maintainability**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - More idiomatic Python code
   - Better type hints and validation

## Testing Updates

The existing tests will need to be updated to:

1. Use the new settings module instead of the config module
2. Mock the HTTP client instead of aiohttp
3. Update any changed interfaces

## Documentation

The documentation has been updated to reflect:

1. New dependencies
2. Updated architecture
3. Modified initialization flow
