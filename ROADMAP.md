## Upcoming Milestones

### Phase 2: Native MCP Integration

#### MCP SDK Integration

- [ ] Integrate official Model Context Protocol Python SDK
- [ ] Create MCP client for Ollama connection
- [ ] Implement proper ClientSession management with lifespan support
- [ ] Add MCP-compatible resource and tool interfaces for Ollama
- [ ] Set up MCP primitive conversions (prompt templates, resources, tools)

**Detailed Plan:**
The MCP SDK integration will leverage the official [Model Context Protocol Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) to provide standardized interfaces between Discord and Ollama. This approach avoids custom code by embracing the MCP protocol directly:

1. Create a proper MCP client that connects to Ollama models
2. Implement ClientSession with efficient lifecycle management
3. Map Discord commands to MCP primitives (prompts, resources, tools)
4. Ensure proper error handling and message conversion

#### Process Management

- [ ] Design robust daemon architecture for MCP server processes
- [ ] Implement python-daemon for background service management
- [ ] Create proper startup and shutdown procedures
- [ ] Add process monitoring and recovery capabilities
- [ ] Develop graceful signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- [ ] Implement logging integration for daemon processes

**Detailed Plan:**
Process management will focus on running the MCP servers reliably as background services:

1. **Daemon Architecture**: Create a supervisor process that manages MCP server instances, handling startup, monitoring, and graceful shutdown.

2. **Service Management**: Implement [python-daemon](https://pypi.org/project/python-daemon/) for proper Unix daemon behavior, including:

   - PID file management to prevent duplicate instances
   - Standard daemon signals handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP)
   - Proper resource cleanup on shutdown
   - User/group permissions handling
   - Daemon detachment from controlling terminal

3. **Lifecycle Handling**:

   - Implement proper startup sequence with dependency checks
   - Create graceful shutdown procedures to ensure no data loss
   - Add health checking and automatic recovery for failed servers
   - Develop service discovery for multiple MCP server instances

4. **Process Monitoring**:
   - Track resource usage (CPU, memory)
   - Implement automatic restart on failure
   - Create system for detecting deadlocks or hangs

### Phase 3: Logging and Observability

#### Structured Logging

- [ ] Integrate structlog for advanced logging
- [ ] Add context processors for request/response data
- [ ] Configure environment-specific log formatters
- [ ] Implement performance and error tracking
- [ ] Set up centralized logging for all components

**Detailed Plan:**
Structured logging will replace simple print statements with a comprehensive logging system:

1. **Structlog Integration**: Use [structlog](https://www.structlog.org/) to create consistent, machine-readable logs with proper context:

   - Create custom processors for Discord and MCP-specific contexts
   - Add structured event logging for all major operations
   - Implement configurable log levels based on environment

2. **Context-Rich Logging**:

   - Add user context to track actions by Discord user
   - Include session IDs to correlate logs across components
   - Track model information and request parameters
   - Add timing information for performance monitoring

3. **Formatters for Different Environments**:

   - Development: Human-readable colorized output
   - Production: JSON format for log aggregation
   - Testing: Minimal output focused on errors

4. **Performance Tracking**:
   - Log request durations and token usage
   - Track memory consumption during model operations
   - Monitor connection pool usage and resource allocation

### Phase 4: Enhanced User Experience

#### Command System

- [ ] Improve command registration with decorators
- [ ] Add automatic help generation
- [ ] Implement command middleware
- [ ] Create more interactive slash commands
- [ ] Add context-aware command suggestions

**Detailed Plan:**
The command system will be rebuilt with a focus on extensibility and user experience:

1. **Decorator-Based Commands**: Replace manual command registration with a decorator system:

   ```python
   @bot.command(name="chat", description="Chat with Ollama model")
   async def chat_command(ctx, message: str, model: str = "llama3"):
       # Command implementation
   ```

2. **Help System**: Generate comprehensive help documentation automatically from command metadata:

   - Support for command categories and grouping
   - Examples for each command
   - Parameter descriptions and types
   - Command permissions and limitations

3. **Command Middleware**: Add support for pre/post-processing hooks:

   - Rate limiting middleware
   - Permission checking
   - Logging and analytics
   - Error handling and formatting

4. **Interactive Commands**: Enhance commands with Discord UI components:
   - Buttons for common actions (continue, regenerate)
   - Dropdowns for model selection
   - Progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Message components that update during processing

#### Memory and Context Management

- [ ] Develop advanced memory retrieval strategies
- [ ] Implement long-term memory storage
- [ ] Create memory tagging and categorization
- [ ] Add memory search and recommendation features
- [ ] Implement conversation context windows

**Detailed Plan:**
Memory and context management will enhance the bot's ability to maintain coherent conversations:

1. **Memory Storage**: Implement persistent storage for conversation histories:

   - Use SQLite for local deployment
   - Support PostgreSQL for production environments
   - Implement proper indexing for fast retrieval
   - Add TTL (time-to-live) policies for memory management

2. **Retrieval Strategies**:

   - Implement semantic search for relevant message retrieval
   - Add recency weighting to prioritize recent context
   - Create summarization for long conversations
   - Develop context window management to stay within token limits

3. **Tagging and Categorization**:

   - Allow users to tag conversations for easy recall
   - Automatically categorize conversations by topic
   - Track important entities mentioned in conversations
   - Create user-specific memory profiles

4. **Search and Recommendations**:
   - Add natural language search across conversation history
   - Implement similarity-based conversation recommendations
   - Develop "continue previous conversation" capabilities
   - Create smart context merging for related conversations
